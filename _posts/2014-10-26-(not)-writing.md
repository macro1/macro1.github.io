Current attempts at writing a post are failing. I think either the
open-ended nature of blogging, or the years of programming already
behind me are making the creative act of finding an idea I would like
to express difficult.

I've actually started a few... But I'm finding that with most topics I
learn enough about it to research it when need calls on it, but not
deeply enough to talk authoritatively on it.

Of course, this is precisely why I am trying to put my thoughts into
posts: I want to be able to organize my opinions into arguments with
merit.

I may resort to 'how-to' posts detailing some best practices, but
hopefully something will materialize before it comes to that.
