Hello, I figured it's about time I tried my hand at blogging. I've been
developing for nearly 2 years as a professional now... Enough time to
develop some opinions about what I like, don't like, or things that
just bug me.

A little about me: I work primarily in Python right now, building web
applications in Django and AngularJS. In my spare time I have been
pretty active with the [SDPUG](http://pythonsd.org/) as well as some
[open source development](https://github.com/macro1).
